# T-Rest_vs_Angularsaurus
A simple angular app and nancyfx rest server, written as my first contact with web development. 

More a documentation of my first steps with SPA/REST web programming than anything else.
The checkins represent incredibly tiny steps from 0 to functioning web app.

Things not represented:

- Getting NPM
- Getting AngularCLI
- Getting NancyFX
- Getting Karma&Jasmine
- Some minor port configurations for NancyFX

Some of the comments are downright lies:

- I never use the "single dinosaur function"
- The first time I wrote that I had created a new component I didn't
